  <P>
    Hello! My name is Christopher Brauch, and welcome to my portfolio! My hopes are that this page will work as 
    a means to not only view my work, but to also learn a little more about me as well!

    <p>Here is where my list of projects and descriptions/languages will go.
        <li>The place I would like to vacation the most: The Moon!</li>
        <li>My favorite band! An acapella performance by the singer of Nickleback</li>
        <li>An animal shelter than I really wish existed!</li>
    </p>
    <p>Here is my favorite and my most natural part, where I talk about me.
        <p>
            I am a freshly-minted 36 year old living in Jacksonville, Florida. I live in a very modern 
            Brady Bunch home, consisting of the following:
              <li>My wonderful partner of four years, Jessica</li>
              <li>My friend since high school, Jeremy</li>
              <li>Marvin and Andy, Jessica's two cats</li>
              <li>Forrest, our also newly-minted 9 week old Welsh Corgi!</li>
        </p>

            My background in coding is nearly non-existant, but I feel I have many experiences that will 
            become transferable skills. I attended college at Misericorida University where I played Division 3 
            lacrosse. As a goalie, I was expected to be an extremely vocal guide for my defenseman, as well as
            prevent the occasional goal or two.

            Around 2003, I became extremely interested in Texas Hold-em thanks to the Moneymaker boom. I found a specialty
            in tournament poker, finding myself consistently in the top 1% of players in terms of Return of Investment.
            Poker taught me how to make my decisions based on incomplete information, but more importantly taught me 
            to become extremely logical in my decisions, something that I hope will translate well with coding!

            In 2010, I also learned how to become a poker dealer, a profession that I still do to this day. Being 
            a good poker dealer requires that I am good at multitasking, having an efficiently-run game while concurrently
            offering above-average customer service. It is certainly a skill to keep a player in line and then being tipped 
            for it!
